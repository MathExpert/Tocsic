# Tocsic

Tocsic: yet another script for adding a table of contents to Markdown documents

It supports keywords for headers (useful for easy vim jumping, as spaces in header names turn into dashes, so jumping by pressing "*" doesn't work).

Also, other features are planned, such as TOC error-checking.
